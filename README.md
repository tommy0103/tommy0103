### Hi 👋 here！

**🐱 About me**

My name is **tommy0103**, and I'm an ACMer & ex-OIer. You can also call me **tomiya**, which is a Japanese name~

As a catgirl, I have the Cat trait! 🐱 But deep down, I'm also a system architect obsessed with elegant kernel designs.

⭐ **My interests & Current Obsessions**

I used to focus heavily on algorithm optimization and problem solving. Now, I'm diving deep into **AI Agent Architecture & Operating Systems**. 
- ⚙️ **Building Agent OS:** Exploring stateless runtimes, unified VFS (Virtual File System) for LLMs, and System Primitives.
- 🧩 **AI-Native APIs:** Advocating for "Mechanism vs. Policy" separation and designing APIs that treat LLMs as ALUs rather than humans.
- 🚀 **Complex Architectures:** Taming the chaos of multi-agent systems with elegant state machines, IPC, and coroutine scheduling.

🚧 **Currently Building**

**[kairos-runtime](https://github.com/tommy0103/kairos-runtime)** (WIP) ⏳✨
*An AI Agent OS kernel built on the first principles of Computer Science.*

I'm tired of the "spaghetti frameworks," hardcoded "Session Types," and context-window abuse in the current Agent ecosystem. `kairos-runtime` is my attempt to bring true OS-level abstraction to LLMs, treating the model as an ALU rather than a human roleplayer:

- 📂 **Unified VFS**: Treating memory, context, and tools as a mountable filesystem (`logos://`), replacing chaotic context arrays with append-only single sources of truth.
- ⚡ **Stateless by Design**: Agents are stateless processes. No "zombie sessions" hanging in memory—everything is cleanly suspended and resumed via logs.
- 🛠️ **Minimal Primitives**: Rejecting bloated "Skill Routing". Everything is achieved through 5 elegant syscalls (`read`, `write`, `patch`, `exec`, `call`) and strict JSON Schemas.
- 🔄 **Process Scheduling**: Implementing coroutine-like task yielding (`logos_complete` with `plan/todo` patterns) and IPC to solve complex, long-horizon multi-agent reasoning.

💖 **Things that can wake me up**

- Eating sweets! I really love puffs 🍰
- Cute things! I'm trying to become a cuter girl 💕
- Give me interesting algorithm problems please! 🧩
- A perfectly designed RFC or an elegant architecture solution! 💡
- Playing maimai all day long 🎵
